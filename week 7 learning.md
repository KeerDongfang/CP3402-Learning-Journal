**Date** 2025/3/23 3:00 PM-6:00PM

## Learning Activities & Resources
- Reviewed PHP fundamentals including `echo`, `if/else` statements, `for/while/foreach` loops, functions with parameters, and `include`.
- Designed and built a simple PHP website that displays a **daily motivational quote** randomly to the user.
- Created four main PHP files: `index.php`, `quotes.php`, `header.php`, and `footer.php`, as well as a `style.css` file for basic visual styling.
- Implemented features like a random quote generator, time-based greetings (morning/afternoon/evening), and reusable page components using `include`.
- Beautified the layout using basic HTML and CSS to improve user experience.

## Estimated Hours
**Approximately 3 hours:**
- 1 hour – Planning and writing the content (quotes and layout)  
- 1.5 hours – Coding and testing PHP functionalities  
- 0.5 hour – Styling, journaling, and cleanup

## Content Insights
This practical task helped reinforce several core PHP concepts:

- Learned how to use `echo` to output HTML dynamically.
- Applied `if/else` statements to control the greeting based on the current time.
- Used `foreach` to loop through an array of quotes and display them.
- Created a function with a parameter to randomly display a quote, improving code reusability.
- Practiced code modularity by using `include` for shared components (header/footer), which made the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
- Styling the site with CSS also reminded me of the importance of front-end and back-end integration.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights
- This activity enhanced my web backend development skills, which is crucial for becoming a full-stack developer.
- Understanding how to structure PHP websites using modular includes will be valuable in future large-scale projects.
- Although simple, this daily quote project can be added to my personal portfolio to showcase my PHP skills.
- I realized that good design and user experience are also key to a successful site, and I’m now motivated to explore frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
- The time-aware greeting feature gave me a taste of how personalisation logic can enhance websites, which could be useful for future intelligent web apps or content delivery systems.
