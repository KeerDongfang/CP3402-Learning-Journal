## Learning Activities & Resources  
I explored the WordPress Content Management System (CMS) as an alternative to Joomla. I learned the differences between hosted platforms like WordPress.com and self-hosted installations using WordPress.org.  
The platform was intuitive and well-suited for a simple site structure. I also discovered the flexibility of WordPress themes and plugins for enhancing functionality and design.
